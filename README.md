# ERCOT Electricity Load Forecasting with GRU and CNN+KMeans

## Overview
This project focuses on electricity load forecasting using deep learning models, specifically GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and CNN+KMeans clustering. The objective is to improve prediction accuracy using historical ERCOT load data combined with weather data from multiple stations.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Merging ERCOT load data with weather data from three weather stations.
  - Handling missing values using forward and backward filling.
  - Feature extraction (Hour, Day, Month, Weekday) for time series analysis.
  - Normalization using Min-Max Scaling.

- **Modeling Approaches:**
  - **GRU Model:**
    - Uses past 24 hours of data to predict the next time step.
    - Two-layer GRU with dropout to prevent overfitting.
    - Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.
  - **CNN+KMeans:**
    - CNN extracts spatial features from the time-series data.
    - KMeans clustering refines the predictions by segmenting data patterns.
    
- **Performance Evaluation:**
  - Metrics used: MAPE, RMSE, NMAE, NRMSE, RÂ² Score.
  - Comparison of GRU and CNN+KMeans models.
  - Visualization of predictions vs actual load data.
  
- **Visualizations and Insights:**
  - Histograms of features to analyze data distribution.
  - Time series plots for actual vs predicted values.
  - Performance comparison of models.
  
## Dataset
- **ERCOT Load Data:** Contains hourly electricity consumption records.
- **Weather Data:** Temperature, humidity, and other meteorological factors from three stations.

## Results
| Model | Season | MAPE | RMSE | NMAE | NRMSE |
